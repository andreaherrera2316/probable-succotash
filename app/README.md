Hello and thank you for the opportunity!

I've used clean architecture principles for this project, which helps keep the code organized and maintainable. The views or screens of the application can be found in the src/presentation/views directory. Each view is self-contained, making it easier to work with and add new features.

I'm excited to discuss the project with you further and address any questions or concerns you may have.

Thank you again for considering my work!
